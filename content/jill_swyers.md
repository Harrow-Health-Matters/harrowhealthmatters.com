She is a qualified Hippocrates Health Educator since 1998, and currently teaches and demonstrates the preparation of PlantBased Living Foods with a Balance of Nutrition.

As a Teacher, Consultant and Chef, Jill's main priority is Food Literacy â€“ just because it is PlantBased does not necessarily mean it is healthy. Understanding Nutrition is key to eating well.
