Seema Shah has worked in healthcare for over a decade as a dentist in UK. Her interest in holistic health made her explore various fields over the years, and has enabled her to come up with a unique plant-based holistic health coaching approach. 

She trained as a holistic health coach at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. In 2009, she trained an a raw food chef. Her passion for yoga and meditation led her to train as a yoga teacher (YICC 200). 

Alongside dentistry, she works as a health coach and educator (with the experience of working alongside a functional medicine doctor in USA for over 2 years), teaches yoga, meditation and educates people on using essential oils for their health and wellbeing. She has been featured in recipe books and magazines for her plant-based recipes, and has been a regular presenter for the Shakthi Morning Show, a show by women empowering others.

Seema also runs her own business, Harmonious Way To Health, which aims to empower minds, energise bodies and enrich souls with 1:1 and group programs, workshops, retreats and more! She also speaks and presents at events with holistic health and motivational topics. 

In her spare time, she loves to paint and spend quality time with her family, which she finds therapeutic!
