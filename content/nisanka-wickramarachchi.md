##### Nisanka helps parents co-parent with a narcissistic partner consistently and effectively preserving your sanity. You can support your children to thrive in their authentic selves whilst you ensure your well-being, goals and desires are met.

Her experience growing up in highly narcissistic environments and later being in narcissistic relationships led her to reflect on her own life at a point when she was severely depressed and suffering from generalised anxiety disorder. Since then, she has been healing from her inner child wounds and narcissistic abuse to build a thriving life for her and her daughter.

Nisanka has worked in the field of education for almost 20 years before she became a Life Coach, Advanced EFT and Matrix Reimprinting Practitioner. She also holds a Diploma in NLP. She is a DISC Facilitator and qualified to work with Narcissism.
