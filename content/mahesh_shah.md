After growing up and schooling in London, I studied medicine in Yorkshire at the Hull York Medical School, graduating with MBBS in 2010. I then completed my general practice training in London with the Royal College of General Practitioners in 2015.

Working in general practice gives me a wonderful opportunity of being at the heart of the community, understanding needs and helping people in various ways.

However, we are seeing an ever increasing number of people suffering from high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, obesity etc.

And what about those persistent and often debilitating experiences like bloating, indigestion, food intolerances, allergies, brain fog, hormonal imbalances and anxiety that I see all too often?â€¦

I sprung into action, wanting to find solutions. I delved into the plethora of research and learnt about the wonders of whole food plant based (WFPB) nutrition and lifestyle changes for great health and well-being. Inspired, this passion led me to a qualification in nutritional therapy, educational talks and presentations for the public and medical professionals, and even writing a nutrition module at university level.
