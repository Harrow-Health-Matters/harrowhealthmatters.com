Divine Health & Wellness is a calm and peaceful space in North Ruislip where clients can escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life, quieten their minds and allow their bodies to descend into deep relaxation. Founder Katrina Evans is an award-winning Complementary Practitioner who uses a holistic approach to adult and child health and wellbeing through natural therapies and mindfulness.

Katrina is Itec qualified, fully insured and has full professional MAR membership with The Association of Reflexologists (AoR) and The Federation of Holistic Therapists (FHT). She offers adults and children personalized Intuitive Reflexology and Holistic Facial treatments tailored to their specific needs, whether that be sleep issues, chronic pain, pregnancy and postnatal, peri/menopause, migraines and headaches or self-care and relaxation.

She is also an accredited Baby Reflex and Toddler Reflex Teacher providing sessions to parents and caregivers either in small groups, 1:1 or online.

Katrina has further expanded her training as a qualified Mindfulness Teacher, approved by The British Psychological Society (BPS) and a member of the Mindfulness Now licensed and accredited teachers network, enabling her to offer a program that blends aspects from both MBSR and MBCT to create a unique person-centred experience, Mindfulness Based Talk Therapy sessions and Health and Wellness Coaching for both adults and children, all of which are available either face to face or online.

Sessions are also available for employers and are designed specifically for their business and with the welfare of their employees at the forefront. Happy, healthy employees equals great productivity and growth!

With her love of Complimentary Therapies and Holistic Health, it felt like a natural progression for Katrina to add training as a Vitamin Specialist and Phlebotomist to her Diet and Nutrition training so that she can provide her clients with targeted blood testing based on an area of concern or that requires deeper investigation like monitoring the effectiveness of HRT medication or tackling Vitamin deficiencies. This enables her to tailor her recommendations or refer on to other medical professionals when needed.

At Divine Health and Wellness, Katrina’s clients’ care and experience are without exception her top priority. Her passion is to support the “whole person“ with their health and wellness concerns. This enables her to provide a successful therapy service that meets their individual needs.
