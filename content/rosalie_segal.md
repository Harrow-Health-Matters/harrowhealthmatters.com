Rosalie Segal graduated with first class honours in Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncture from Westminster University in 2008 and was awarded the Nutri Centre Prize for ‘best overall performance’ for the last two years consecutively of her degree course.

​Rosalie has taken additional Tuina massage courses at Westminster University with Rosey Grandage (internal and external conditions) and finds patients love the hands-on approach it brings to the treatment. 

She was also privileged to undertake her Alexander Technique training with renowned first generation teachers Walter Carrington (who took over FM Alexander's training course) and his wife Dylis Carrington at the Constructive Teaching Centre and has been in practice now for over 23 years.
