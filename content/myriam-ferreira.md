As a Holistic Wellness and Wellbeing Coach/Counsellor, I am dedicated to supporting individuals on their journey to optimal health and happiness. With a focus on mental, and physical health, I offer personalised support to help clients overcome challenges, build resilience, and create lasting change. My approach encompasses a wide range of areas including stress management, dealing with anxiety, emotional wellbeing, and trauma recovery. I combine evidence-based practices with a holistic perspective, and also incorporate the power of nature through walks and mindful connection. By empowering individuals to unlock their full potential, I help them live fulfilling and balanced lives.
