Hina is a licensed acupuncturist with a BSc (Hons) Degree in Acupuncture from the highly respected College of Integrated Chinese Medicine in Reading.

She trained in both Traditional Chinese Medicine and Five Element Acupuncture and provides an integrated approach to treatment. By combining both forms of acupuncture, Hina is able to treat a broad range of emotional and physical conditions.

Hina is a member of the British Acupuncture Council and is bound by their codes of practice which ensure patients receive the highest standards of professional care. She is also committed to learning and regularly expands her knowledge and skills by attending continuing professional development training and events.

Prior to becoming an acupuncturist, Hina worked in the corporate sector and understands the impact of a busy and stressful life on health. Having personally experienced the transformative effect of acupuncture, Hina decided to change careers to be able to help others in the same way acupuncture helped her.
