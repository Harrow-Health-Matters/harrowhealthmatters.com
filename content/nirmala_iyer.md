Profile of Nirmala Iyer
I started my Yoga Journey a little over a decade ago and after 4
years of practicing as a student, I wanted to deepen my
understanding of Yoga as a therapeutic way of life, egged on by
the lower back pain that a few family members (across age
groups) were dealing with!
I completed my International Yoga Teachers Training Certificate
under my Yoga Guru, Pundit Radheshyam Mishra from Yoga Life
Global India. In parallel I also got introduced to scriptural study,
pursuing the study of the Bhagavad Gita under a qualified Guru
(teacher).
My teaching journey commenced in 2014 at the Yoga Bharati, San Jose CA. I pursued this
journey once we moved to London, taking weekly classes and teaching at organized
workshops;I also mentored several yoga teachers in a teacher training course that finished in
October 2020.
My teaching style focuses not just on body awareness, strength & flexibility, but also on
coordination of breath with stretching of the physical body. I use a lot of chanting, sounds and
Pranayama which induces energy & quietude. I also complement my practice with techniques
for relaxation of the body & mind prescribed by the Yoga Institute,Mumbai, India. My students
have often told me I have a calming voice, cheerful disposition and I make yoga accessible to
everyone. I adapt my classes to suit the age group that I am teaching and I am comfortable with
students aged 5 to 80 years old.
My holistic yoga journey has been fulfilling, healing so many people from all walks of life and in
all corners of the globe (Singapore/Australia/Mauritius/India/Europe/USA). In an effort to make
this path accessible to as many people, and more so in the times of this pandemic I have taken
my journey online:
