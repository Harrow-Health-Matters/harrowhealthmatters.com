Varsha is a Medical Herbalist with over 31 years of experience in the field of complementary medicine and a degree in Herbal Medicine. She has vast knowledge of:

- Western Herbs
- Indian and Ayurvedic Herbs
- Chinese Herbs

Varshaâ€™s knowledge of these 3 areas of herbalism, is combined to maximise the benefits of the phytochemicals (natural plant chemicals) that nature has given to us packaged as beautiful plants.
She offers private health consultations in her Stanmore clinic and via video.  You can book a free discovery call with her to find out about how she could help you with your health.  She works holistically from the perspective of mind, body and spirit; looking at diet, lifestyle and other things that impact health.  She may send you for biochemical or stool tests and scans as necessary to give you the best care possible.  Sometimes she will refer you to other experts if required and recommend supplements if there are deficiencies to address.  

Harrow Health Matters was founded by Varsha to support her community to get well and stay well.
