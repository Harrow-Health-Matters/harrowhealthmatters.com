I began my journey in Osteopathy at the age of 19 when my mother suggested it as a profession when I was leaving school, so in 1975 I enrolled at the College of Naturopathy & Osteopathy (now BCOM). My father must have been overjoyed because he always believed in a Nature Cure way of life and here was I becoming an Osteopath & Naturopath. In 1985 I also became a Homeopath.

As a Osteopath, Naturopath and Homeopath, I believe that the body has the ability to heal itself, and thus all my treatments aim to assist the body's repair process and return the body to a normal state of functioning, whether there are structural or general health problems.
