         <h1>Lisa Morris</h1>
         <p>Lisa teaches Iyengar yoga from a purpose-built specialist studio in Bushey Heath, near Watford, Hertfordshire. During 2020 Lisa has been teaching online and has been welcoming yoga students to class from all over the UK and beyond! She invites you into her beautiful little tranquil garden space, set under an old oak and beside the green belt fields of Bushey. Learn more about healing yourself through this clever systematic ancient technology, with a focus on alignment. Lisa is experienced and creative, sharing what she has learned of BKS Iyengar’s ingenious use of props to help everyone move with more ease. Lisa has found this technique superior to any other long-term practise, to help her navigate life. She is grateful to have trained with some of the best teachers in the world, including Geeta Iyengar before her passing. In 2920She currently learns online with Prashant and Abhihata Iyengar, in India, but also London teachers, recognised as senior authorities in the subject.<br>
A trusted teacher is always key to really understanding yoga, Lisa also aims to support your own self-practise.</p>
<p>Previously Lisa trained as a contemporary dancer/choreographer working as a dance community officer teacher and event organiser teacher for 8 years.
She tried a yoga class on Bondai beach, Australia, on a gap year, whilst grumpily recovering in a plaster cast from a fall into a ravine!</p>
<p>The yoga somehow cheered her up&hellip; and gave her the mental space and physical freedom that she was craving. It felt good.</p>
<p>So when she returned to the UK she found an inspiring Iyengar yoga teacher, who she still studies with to this day.</p>
<p>Lisa LOVES sharing this art form with her students, it&rsquo;s a passion.</p>
<p>She enjoys the challenge of discovering the &lsquo;puzzle&rsquo; every new student brings. Each of us has our own stories, we are all individual, however, the principles of body alignment are universal. So many of us can benefit from a damn good yoga class, it should be on everyone’s ‘to do’ list!</p>
<p>Lisa is experienced with people of all sizes and abilities, men and women with different strengths and weaknesses, stiffness and mobility.</p>
<p>She has worked regularly with people with disabilities, injured people and anyone who enjoys learning to connect the body and brain intelligently, so that the whole system is working in better harmony.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,
Lisa Morris</p>
